***To compare 2 sorting algorithms:***

1) QuickSort
2) Selection

To plot graphics:

> 1. Dependence Quantity of operations(compares and swaps) on lenth of the massive at fixed order

> 2. Dependence Quantity of operations(compares and swaps) on ordery of the massive at fixed lenth of massive( point "0" - random, point "N" - ordered, point "-N" - Unordered)
